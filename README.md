## âœ… How to Build and Run the Project

Thank you again for checking out my project! Here's a quick step-by-step to help get it up and running:

### 1. Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK 8.0 or later](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
- A C#-compatible code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code with the C# Dev Kit)


### 2. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/TodoApi.git
cd TodoApi
(Replace with your actual GitHub link)


## 3. Restore Dependencies
   
dotnet restore
   

## 4. Build the Project

dotnet build

## 5. Run the API
dotnet run

(Then you should see an output like :Now listening on: https://localhost:5001
)

## 6. Notes 

- ASP.NET Core MVC pattern (Model, View, Controller)

- Uses Entity Framework Core via ApplicationDbContext.cs

- Configurations in appsettings.json and Program.cs

- Views and controllers for basic student management (in progress)

- Project is incomplete but scaffolded
